The issue was mitigated by 14:15 US/Pacific.\nWe understand this issue has affected our valued customers and users, and we apologize to those who were affected.\n# ROOT CAUSE\nGoogle Admin Console has multiple backend components to facilitate administration of Google Workspace domains. One such component is a job that handles an administrator’s ability to browse and update settings.\nAn unexpected queries per second (QPS) increase in traffic caused the service responsible for handling admin settings to be overloaded, which led to throttling of requests. The sudden increase was caused by another service responsible for syncing user’s admin role data. Google has an internal load-shedding safety mechanism to appropriately throttle the problematic service; however, in this case, the safety mechanism unintentionally throttled all traffic instead of only the component causing the increased QPS.\n# REMEDIATION AND PREVENTION\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the issue on 16 July 2021 at 11:44 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation. Efforts to scale up the number of servers began at 12:42 to deal with the increase in traffic. Once the nature of the problem was determined, the origin of the increase in QPS was manually throttled, fully mitigating the issue by 14:15.\nTo prevent recurrence and reduce the impact of similar events, we are taking the following actions:\nRepair load-shedding mechanisms to appropriately throttle traffic in order to limit the scope of impact for issues of this type.\nImprove internal processes to throttle single clients sending a high number of queries unexpectedly.\n# DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF IMPACT\nGoogle Admin Console: Admins experienced intermittent elevated HTTP 500 errors when trying to browse or update settings, including Gmail and client-side encryption settings. Identity sync changes may have been delayed until the incident was resolved.\nGoogle Voice: ​​Admins were unable to access most of the private branch exchange (PBX) features in the Admin Console and experienced elevated latency in processing subscription change events.\nGoogle Endpoint Management: Admins experienced elevated HTTP 500 errors when trying to browse or update security related settings.\nGoogle Vault: Retention and Hold flows experienced elevated errors.","status":"AVAILABLE"},{"created":"2021-07-19T18:45:00+00:00","modified":"2021-07-19T19:00:29+00:00","when":"2021-07-19T18:45:00+00:00","text":"An incident report has been posted here \u003chttps://www.google.com/appsstatus/ir/rwi0ddqtn4ewq72.pdf\u003e.","status":"AVAILABLE"},{"created":"2021-07-16T21:33:00+00:00","modified":"2021-07-16T21:33:44+00:00","when":"2021-07-16T21:33:00+00:00","text":"The problem with Google Voice has been resolved.

The issue was mitigated by 14:15 US/Pacific.\nWe understand this issue has affected our valued customers and users, and we apologize to those who were affected.\n# ROOT CAUSE\nGoogle Admin Console has multiple backend components to facilitate administration of Google Workspace domains. One such component is a job that handles an administrator’s ability to browse and update settings.\nAn unexpected queries per second (QPS) increase in traffic caused the service responsible for handling admin settings to be overloaded, which led to throttling of requests. The sudden increase was caused by another service responsible for syncing user’s admin role data. Google has an internal load-shedding safety mechanism to appropriately throttle the problematic service; however, in this case, the safety mechanism unintentionally throttled all traffic instead of only the component causing the increased QPS.\n# REMEDIATION AND PREVENTION\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the issue on 16 July 2021 at 11:44 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation. Efforts to scale up the number of servers began at 12:42 to deal with the increase in traffic. Once the nature of the problem was determined, the origin of the increase in QPS was manually throttled, fully mitigating the issue by 14:15.\nTo prevent recurrence and reduce the impact of similar events, we are taking the following actions:\nRepair load-shedding mechanisms to appropriately throttle traffic in order to limit the scope of impact for issues of this type.\nImprove internal processes to throttle single clients sending a high number of queries unexpectedly.\n# DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF IMPACT\nGoogle Admin Console: Admins experienced intermittent elevated HTTP 500 errors when trying to browse or update settings, including Gmail and client-side encryption settings. Identity sync changes may have been delayed until the incident was resolved.\nGoogle Voice: ​​Admins were unable to access most of the private branch exchange (PBX) features in the Admin Console and experienced elevated latency in processing subscription change events.\nGoogle Endpoint Management: Admins experienced elevated HTTP 500 errors when trying to browse or update security related settings.\nGoogle Vault: Retention and Hold flows experienced elevated errors.","status":"AVAILABLE"},"status_impact":"SERVICE_DISRUPTION","severity":"medium","service_key":"gh79SrQk6wqonWoxPdCm","service_name":"Google Voice","affected_products":[{"title":"Google Voice","id":"gh79SrQk6wqonWoxPdCm"}],"uri":"incidents/HMLrbuEu2CV2z3tZSRZQ"},{"id":"13HrvKYid4MbbLx1gQAW","number":"11632866115259274980","begin":"2021-06-22T05:53:00+00:00","created":"2021-06-22T05:53:00+00:00","end":"2021-06-22T07:33:00+00:00","modified":"2021-06-22T08:23:03+00:00","external_desc":"We are experiencing a temporary issue with Google Workspace Support in which administrators may encounter slowness (event timeouts) when creating or updating support cases.\nThe Google Workspace Admin Console (Google Admin) is still fully operational.","updates":[{"created":"2021-06-22T07:33:00+00:00","modified":"2021-06-22T08:23:03+00:00","when":"2021-06-22T07:33:00+00:00","text":"The issue in which administrators may encounter slowness (event timeouts) when creating or updating support cases. has been resolved for all administrators.
